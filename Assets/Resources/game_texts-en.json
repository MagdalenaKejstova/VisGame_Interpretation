            "yAxis": "The <b><color=#5FBFB5>Y-AXIS</color></b> is the <b>vertical</b> line on the left. Usually, the Y-axis shows the <color=#639C4E>value</color>. Here, you can see the <b>temperature in degrees Celsius</b>.",
            "dataPoints": "The <b><color=#639C4E>DOTS</color></b> in this chart represent <color=#639C4E>data POINTS</color>. Each dot signifies a <b>combination of values on the y-axis and the x-axis</b>. For example, we can see that it was about 10°C on 1.3.",
            "line": "Finally, the <b><color=#FFD35C>LINE</color></b> connecting the dots is what makes this chart a Line Chart. It's that simple! The purpose of the line is to show us different <b><color=#639C4E>TRENDS</color></b> occurring over time. A trend means the values went up (or down) for <b>several points in a row</b>. ",
            "example": "For example, we can see that it got progressively colder between the 14th and the 21st of March.",
            "peeksTroughs": "Points where the line changes direction from going up to going down are called <b><color=#639C4E>PEAKS</color></b>. Troughs are points where the previously decreasing line starts going up. The <color=#639C4E>highest</color> peak and <color=#639C4E>lowest</color> trough are called <b><color=#639C4E>EXTREMES</color></b>. ",
            "extremes": "The point with the highest value on the y-axis is the <color=#639C4E>MAXIMUM</color>. The point with the lowest value is the <color=#639C4E>MINIMUM</color>. ",
